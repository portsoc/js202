# JS Test

* Download a zip of this `js_test_2` repository or (preferably) clone it thus:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/portsoc/js_test.git
```
*  From your new local `js_test_2` folder, open `index.html` in a browser to see which tests fail.
*  Edit `index.js`; improving and adding code until all the tests pass.
